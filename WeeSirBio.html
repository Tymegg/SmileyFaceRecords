<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> Weezer is commonly considered to be the worst alt-rock band of all time, but, The Wee-Sirs are here to change that, to show the world how much of a lyrical and music genius Rivers Cuomo is. Many other Weezer cover bands came and went, but The Wee-Sirs are here to show everyone how it's truly done, by barely staying on-pitch and on-beat, and using poorly made midi intrsumentals. Watch out Rivers, The Wee-Sirs might be giving you a run for your money! </p></h3>
<br>
<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> The Wee-Sirs consists of: Mr Goodman (lead vocals), Tymeggs (backup vocals, instrumentals, production) </p></h3>
