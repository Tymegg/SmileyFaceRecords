<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> Mike and Melissa is a musical project created by Ann Alex, taking inspiration from the YouTube animated series going by the same name, created by Mike Chenoweth. The project gained life sometime in the middle of summer 2024, it has since then being recieved relatively well by critics and fans. Ann only gave us permision to release only one of the albums, so don't expect to find much outside of their BandCamp page... unfortunately for Ann, I'm the one writting their bio page, so I can be petty and write trivia about them that is completely false. Like, did you know that every time Ann goes to McDonalds they order a big mac with nothing on it except pickles? Not only that but they also order it with EXTRA PICKLES and LIZARDS and PUMPKIN SEEDS. I think that's very fucked up, why would you do that, Ann? </p></h3>
