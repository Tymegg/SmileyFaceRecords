Mario Marioskey was very strange artist that used to be on our label, before we had to kick him out after he threatened to kill the founder for seemingly no reason at all. We originally planned on releasing his album on CD in January of 2025, but it never happened due to the previously mentioned incident. One prototype CD was created however, and we wish to get rid of it once and for all.

Mario Marioskey will not be given a single cent from any purchases.
