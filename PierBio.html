<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> In the 1960s, the music scene in the United Kingdom would change forever, as The Beatles showed up and played songs so revolutionary, it would go on to change rock history forever. This story has nothing to do with Pier. Hiding somewhere within plain sight of Britania's land, wearing a Greggs hoodie, making instrumental melodies, hides Pier. A rather very homosexual figure, Pier does very homosexual activities, such as homosexual breathing, homosexual talking, and homosexual composing. Very gay. </p></h3>
