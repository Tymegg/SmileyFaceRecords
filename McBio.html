<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> Lostwave, women with massive bosoms, and a few cats running around. That, is all it takes for McKid to be happy in life. Originating from the most boring country in the world, Montenegro, McKid is an artist first, singer... forty-fifth. They like playing weird fuckass PlayStation games you've never heard of before, and drawing women with green eggs for a head, and massive fucking tits. </p></h3>
