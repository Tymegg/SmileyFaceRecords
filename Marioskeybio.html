<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> Somewhere within the city of Middelburg, lives a very strange, Mario-obessed man. While his real name may not be known, his stage name is so haunting that it'll stick with you until you die. Mario Marioskey, what a strange name. He spends his days creating loud, poorly mixed, instrumental tracks that'll make your ears bleed... but yet, you'll find yourself loving them for just how original and strange they are. Once you start talking to him, and look past his weird feet and fart fetishes you truly realize just how great of a person Mario is to be around, and you'll just wish to talk to him more and more, to learn more, but you most likely never will, becuase he usually only replies with "ALBUM". </p></h3>
