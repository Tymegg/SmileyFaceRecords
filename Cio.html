<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> C, or c, is the third letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other Western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is cee, plural cees. C may also refer to the classical piano composer on our record label. Very little is known about cher (yes, those are cher pronouns, che/cher). One day che just randomly reached out to Smiley Face Records via email and sent us some songs and told us to keep the money. When asked if we could donate cher earnings to charity che replied with "Fuc [sic] charity". </p></h3>

<h3><p style="color:e2fffe;"> Contact C: CCCCCCCCCCCCC@reborn.com (no, this is not a joke, this is cher actual email address) </p></h3>
